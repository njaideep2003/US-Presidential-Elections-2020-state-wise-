# US state wise Presidential Elections in 2020
### This repository consists of Data visualizations of US state wise Presidential Elections in 2020.
### `US Presidential Elections 2020.ipynb - Colab.pdf` file contains all the Visualizations that I did.

### 1. Handling Datasets:
- The raw data file `1976-2020-US president elections.csv` was from kaggle.
- so the raw data file consisted data from the year 1976 to 2020. So I filtered 2020 data which is required for me.
- So the new dataset is `election_data_2020.csv`. But in this dataset the values of notes were not present.
- So I handled the data and filled the notes column and saved it as `election_data_2020_updated.csv`.

### US Map Shapefile:
- The US Map shapefile source url is "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PublicaMundi/MappingAPI/master/data/geojson/us-states.json".
- Then I saved this into a json file `us-states.json`.

 ### 3. Visualizations:
- horizontal bar plot showing distribution of members in each party.
- graph showing the candidate votes.
- graph showing total votes.
- scatter plot showing candidate votes vs total votes by state.
- Bar plot showing the Average Candidate Votes per Party by State.
- US States Map.
- US map depicting the Winning party in each state in the Presidential Elections 2020.
- Donut chart showing the percentage of seats won by each party.
